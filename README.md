**Object Oriented Programing Concepts**

_Class_ - A Class is a blueprint of an object which can be used in the main code/script. There are properties and functions inside a class, an the properties are mentioned inside the constructor.

_Object_ - An Object is an instance of a class. The object could become any real-world entity.

_Abstraction_ - An Abstraction is a method which could hide some codes and data using functions. Example: _function Start(){}_

_Inheritance_ - An Inheritance is the concept of deriving sub class from parent class (base class). The Keyword _extends_ is used for deriving from a first class/parent class to a second class/sub class. The Keyword _super_ is used for deriving the properties from the parent class constructor to the sub class constructor.

**Arithmetic Operators**

_Concatenation_ - Concatenation is the process of joining 2 strings/numbers/variables using the plus (+) symbol. Example: "Hello" + "World" = HelloWorld

_Modulus Operator_ A Modulus Operator is an operator which provides the remainder of a division.

**Comparision Operators**

=== - The triple equals are used to make sure if a value is the same with another value.

!==,>,<,>=,<=

**Data Types**

_Numbers_ - Numbers is a data type which holds integer numbers (negative, positive, or 0) or float numbers (decimal numbers).

_String_ - A String is a data type which stores letters,numbers,etc. inside double quoutes or quoutation marks. Examople: "HelloWorld123"

_Boolean_ - A Boolean is a data type which only holds _true_ or _false_ values.

_Undefined_ - Undefined is an unknown data type. Example: var hello;

_Null_ - Null is a data type that stores nothing.

**Array**

_Array_ - An Array is a data structure which stores different types of data together in a single variable. An array could be represented using "[]" after making a variable. To access an element in an array you need to use index, which refers to the position of an element inside an array. An array is zero (0) index based, so if you for example are refering to the first element inside an array, it will be 0 index instead of 1. The length of an array is the total number of elements in that array.

_Push Operation_ - The push operation in an array is used for adding more elements inside that array. It will be added as the last element in that array.

_Pop Operation_ - The pop operation in an array is used for removing elements inside that array. It will remove the last element in that array.

**Loops**

_For Loop_ - The For Loop will repeat the code inside it until the condition is met.
Syntax: for (initialization expression; coditional expression; increment/decrement expression){
    //code
}

**Conditional Programming**

_If Condition_ - This will check weather the condition is met, then action to be performed will be executed.
Syntax: if(condition){
    //code
}

_If Elseif Condition_ - This will check if the first condition is true, which executes its code. If not, then the second condition will be checked and if its true, then its code will be executed.

_Switch Condition_ 
Syntax: switch(variable){
    case 1: //code
    break;
    case 2: //code
    break;
    default: break;
}
